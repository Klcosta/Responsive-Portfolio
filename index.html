            Hello,
            <br><br>
            Thank you for visiting my portfolio.
            <br><br>
            My name is Keith Costa. I have a genuine love for continued growth. 
            I am constantly searching for new ways to continue improving myself and my craft.
            <br><br>
            I have always been very artistically inclined. 
            As a child my notebooks were filled with doodles and sketches. 
            I have been working for several years to develop this passion and grow as a designer and web developer.
            I cherish the challenges of creating new forms of communication that transcend language and creating a more aesthetically pleasing world.
            <br><br>
            I am well versed in Adobe Photoshop Illustrator and InDesign which I most commonly use.
            I have been honing my skills with these programs through personal projects and formal education. 
            I also have experience with Adobe Aftereffects and Premiere.
            <br><br>
            I also love traveling. My nomadic nature has allowed me to fulfill my goals of constant self improvement by constantly pushing myself to live new and exciting adventures. 
            It has helped me develop new ways of communicating and expressing myself. 
            Follow my adventures on the upcoming blog Nomadxnature.
            <br><br>
            Thank you again for visiting my portfolio.
